### Sprint 1

#### Goals

The goal for this sprint is to create the database and start developing the CRUD functionalities and the program logic, including retrieving data and login validations.

#### Review

For this sprint, 4 user stories have been marked as Done, which all correspond to the creation of the database. In addition, 6 other user stories have been added to the review stage, as, although already pre-fulfilled, all are required to go through testing, both automated and manual. This review stage will span throughout the next sprint, as it is important to test the functionalities before starting to develop an Graphical User Interface. It is also important to note that, to fulfil the manual testing, a sample GUI will be created on the next sprint to conclude that all functionalities are working according to the requirements.

#### Retrospective

During the sprint, It has been noticed that, while preparing and planning the sprint, the number of tasks to be completed have been underestimated. This means that initially only 3 user stories have been selected from the product backlog when, in reality, 9 user stories have been passed to the in progress section. Also, this sprint has presented two blockers which were: not using the correct syntax for the creation of the database (using MySQL instead of SQL), which caused errors with the primary keys; not remembering how to use LINQ method syntax for method join queries, where the solution was to use the query syntax.

### Sprint 2

#### Goals

The goal for this sprint is to create the tests for the CRUD functionalities and adapt the code so that all tests can pass.

#### Review

For this sprint, 7 user stories have been marked as Done, which correspond to the CRUD functionalities that have passed through testing. In addition, 2 other user stories have been added to the project backlog and have been marked as done, since all have met the acceptance criteria that require tests to pass. During this sprint, not all user stories from the Review tab have been marked has done since the tests have not yet passed, which will lead to code inspection and code modification. This makes the goal for the following sprint to finish modifying the code and start developing the visual interface, to meet the MVP definition of done.



#### Retrospective

During the sprint, I have noticed that testing is an area that requires more that 1 day to complete as, when showing flaws in the code, it can lead to stress and anxiety. It has also been noticed while testing that, due to the lack of extended knowledge on the Microsoft Entity framework, there have been problems with the test run, due to tests not running in parallel or in a specific order. For the following sprints, I plan to improve on how I plan the amount of tasks required to complete, accounting for the worst case scenarios where things might not go as planned. This will help as, if things go south, I will have more time to focus on the individual tasks and be in a more healthier environment.
As to improve for following projects, I will plan more than 1 sprint to create unit tests so that I can work with more time and have a less stressing environment.
