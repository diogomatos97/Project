### Sprint 1

#### Goals

The goal for this sprint is to create the database and start developing the CRUD functionalities and the program logic, including retrieving data and login validations.

#### Review

For this sprint, 3 user stories have been marked as Done, which all correspond to the creation of the database. In addition, 6 other user stories have been added to the review stage, as, altough already pre-fulfilled, all are required to go through testing, both automated and manual. This review stage will span throughout the next sprint, as it is important to test the functionalities before starting to develop an Graphical User Interface. It is also important to note that, to fulfill the manual testing, a sample GUI will be created on the next sprint to conclude that all functionalities are working according to the requirements.

#### Retrospective

During the sprint, It has been noticed that, while preparing and planning the sprint, the number of tasks to be completed have been underestimated. This means that initially only 3 user stories have been selected from the product backlog when, in reality, 9 user stories have been passed to the in progress section. Also, this sprint has presented two blockers which were: not using the correct syntac for the creation of the database (using MySQL instead of SQL), which caused errors with the primary keys; not remembering how to use Linq method syntax for method join queries, where the solution was to use the query syntax.
